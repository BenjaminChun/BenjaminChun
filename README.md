👋 Holla amigos, I’m @BenjaminChun Computer Science undergrad ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

I am most familiar with Python and JS, but willing and able to quickly learn others.
Passionate about automating away the boring stuff.
Keen interest in hackathons and competitions. Open to collaborate! ༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ

Dropping a nugget for entertainment and also very apt in describing my current situation:
> Why spend 10 mins everyday doing the same task when you can spend 1 month trying to automate it ;)
