- 👋 Holla amigos, I’m @BenjaminChun Computer Science undergrad ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

- Most familiar with Python and JS, but willing and able to quickly learn others.
- Passionate about automating away the boring stuff.
```
"Why spend 10 mins everyday doing the same task when you can spend 1 month trying to automate it ;)"
```
- Keen interest in hackathons and competitions. Open to collaborate! ༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ
